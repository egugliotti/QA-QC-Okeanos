# QA-QC Okeanos

## Pupose of this code

The QA-QC Okeanos code is designed to help video annotaters of dives conducted by OER's NOAA ship *Okeanos Explorer* (EX is used to denote these dives) to conduct a series of tests that will identify potential *errors*. These *errors* are not necessarily wrong but are things that the annotater should double check either in the video or in their spreadsheet.

While much of the code can be easily copied and pasted to QA/QC any EX dive, there are several chunks that need to be altered for every dive. Internal comments should explain how to alter these chunks to make the code executable.
